ðŸ§  Simplified Protocol (Recommended for Your Use Case)
We can drop the pixel request-response mechanism entirely.

âœ… New Protocol Plan:
GPIO Bit(s)    Function
[7:0]    Pixel data (value 0â€“255)
8    data_valid (from Pi)
9    data_ack (from FPGA)
10    end_of_image (set by Pi for final pixel)

Total = 11 GPIO pins (easily fits in your 14-pin bus)

ðŸ§  Workflow
Pi writes a pixel to GPIO[7:0] and sets data_valid = 1

FPGA sees data_valid = 1, reads pixel, sets data_ack = 1

Pi waits for data_ack = 1, then clears data_valid = 0

FPGA sees data_valid = 0, clears data_ack = 0

Repeat for next pixel

After last pixel, Pi sets end_of_image = 1 for 1 cycle
